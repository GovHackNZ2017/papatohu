   "serviceDetail": "Aviva believes that the safest place for women and\nchildren should be their homes and that, in order to\nachieve this, we need to enable homes to become\nviolence free.  For many years, the pathway from\nfamily violence to safety has been for women and\nchildren to leave their homes and move to alternative\naccommodation. Following this pathway requires an\nalready vulnerable woman, who often has children,\nto find alternative accommodation or enter a Safe\nHouse for short-term respite. This further entrenches\nsocial isolation and introduces the risk of\nhomelessness in a region where affordable, safe\nhousing is in short supply.  Shine safe@home\nCanterbury: A collaborative response to family\nviolence  Shine's safe@home aims to enable women\nand children at risk of repeat family violence to\nremain safely at home and in a familiar environment,\nrather than enter a Safe House or other temporary\naccommodation. The service makes the homes of\nwomen and children at risk of recidivist family\nviolence safer by installing a range of practical\nsecurity measures which may include security\nlighting and alarms; door and window restrictors,\npeepholes; or creating an internal safe room. Once\nsecured, the house is visited by the NZ Fire Service\nto ensure that exits are still accessible and install\nsmoke detectors.  Shine safe@home offers women\nand children the choice of remaining in a physically\nsafe home, connected with supportive friends and\nfamily within their own community, whilst\nsimultaneously receiving specialist support and\nadvice to move towards a life free from violence,\neither with or without their partner.",

Specialist Peer Support provides the\nconnection of shared experience and understanding\nwhen it comes to family violence. A `peer\n�\nrepresents hope and the tangible evidence that a life\nfree from violence is achievable. They are the\nembodiment of the possibility of a better, safer life\nand they also demonstrate that overcoming family\nviolence is something to be proud of and to share.\nThe value of specialist peer support is well\nestablished across a broad range of health and\nsocial needs, but it is a new service model for family\nviolence in New Zealand. Research into peer\nsupport indicates that when it is coupled with other\nservices, client outcomes are significantly improved.\nWe believe that Specialist Peer Support adds yet\nanother layer to the range of support already offered\nby Aviva.",

This is for Years 4-13.\nWe've incorporated our recently successful\n#Upstand social-action campaign that was\nco-designed with young people, with the best parts\nof our evidence-based workshop, to give you a\npowerful 30-45 minute experiential presentation that\neffectively educates and empowers young people\n(and their parents/wh\n�nau/ community members)\nto be #Upstanders! The benefits of offering a shorter\npresentation are: less time away from class, working\nparents could attend in their lunch-break and the\ncost is considerably reduced. As per our 3 hour\nworkshop, this programme is based around the\nMental Health Foundation\n�s \n�5 Ways To\nWellbeing\n� (connect, give, be active, take notice\nand keep learning). This framework is supported by\nthe Ministry of Education to help communities in\nChristchurch, based on surveys taken\npost-earthquakes.  Studies have shown us that\nexclusively lecturing to people, or handing out\npamphlets is less effective than engaging the\naudience via active learning techniques such as;\nshared brainstorming, ice breakers, team work and\nproblem-based learning. Each of the \n�5\nWays\n� will include active learning techniques\nsuch as evidenced-based information, videos\n(including our latest production written by 18 year old\nstudent and #Upstand competition winner), music\nand fun demonstrations that will involve the\naudience, AND prizes! We KNOW that young people\nare powerful agents of change, they have the most\nwisdom about how the social dynamics of their\nschools and communities work and the most\nleverage with their peers when it comes to\nencouraging pro-social behaviours, so we want to\nempower them to `be the change\n� \n� each of\nthe \n�5 Ways\n� will also include a follow-up\npro-social event/activity that the school and\ncommunity can easily run (see examples in our\n'Opportunities for Change' section).  We know that\nyouth development is triggered when young people\nfully participate, therefore at the end of the\npresentation, the students (and parents) will be\noffered the opportunity to create their very own\n\n�Be The Change (insert school name) Team\n�.\nThe volunteers will stay behind and `sign-up\n� and\nthey will receive a `Be The Change NZ\n� badge\n(this will help spread the positive messages and\nencourage others to join).

This camp is definitely\nphysical and structured, and has an added\ncomponent of learning to it.   The campsite is\nsituated in Peel Forest close to Geraldine, and is\nisolated in the bush around Peel Forest Lodge. The\ncamp itself is eco-friendly and self-sufficient and has\neverything we need to have a wonderful camping\nexperience. Youth will be expected to help prepare\nand cook all meals and take part in clean up\nprocedures. There will be a morning component of\nclassroom-style life skills tutoring, including\ncommunication skills, identifying how and why we\nthink, feel and act the way we do, also identifying our\nbehaviors. We work on the youth's\n� self-esteem,\nconfidence and teamwork. If there is any area you\nfeel your child is needing some encouragement with,\nthen it would be useful to let us know on the\napplication form so we are aware of it before we\nleave Christchurch.  Youth will be challenged in the\nafternoons with physical team-based activities such\nas abseiling, canyoning, white water rafting and a\nhigh ropes course. They will learn outdoor survival\nskills which help them build confidence and\nindependence, nurturing their interest in the outdoors\nas they acquire knowledge to which they may never\nhave had access.  We work with the kids individually,\nsupporting and encouraging them to create structure\nand routine as they learn new skills they can apply in\ntheir everyday lives away from camp.   For young\npeople, social interaction is one of the major factors\nin their development. It teaches them how to\ncommunicate with different types of people, which is\nessential to their success later in life. As well as\nschool, it is important that all youth have the\nopportunity to interact with other young people in\ndifferent environments. Kiwi Family Trust developed\nEmpowering Our Youth camps to provide this\nopportunity, as we understand that it can be difficult\nfor some families to provide such an opportunity due\nto finances, work commitments, or other unforeseen\ncircumstances. We work with youth from\nlow-income, underprivileged backgrounds, with or\nwithout behavioral issues and youth with intellectual\ndisabilities.  Kiwi Family Trust developed\nEmpowering Our Youth camps  for the following\npurposes:  To encourage the involvement and\nparticipation of social interaction with their peers\nduring the camp.  To improve the children\n�s\nattitudes and learning behaviors.  To actively\nreinforce higher self-esteem, self-awareness,\nself-respect and confidence levels.  To provide the\nopportunity for children to think and act more\npositively.  To educate the children to respect their\nenvironment including the different native plants and\nvegetation they come across during bush walks.\nCharges: The camps cost $480 per child, and\ndepending on income, we can sponsor $320 leaving\n$160 to be paid.

Further, we\nare not experts about obesity, weight-loss or food\naddiction.  The primary purpose of OA is to carry the\nmessage that recovery is possible.  We simply want\nto share our experience with others who desire our\nhelp. Founded in 1960, today there are about 6,500\nOA group meetings in over 65 countries.  One\nbecomes a member simply by coming along to\nmeetings and having the desire to stop compulsive\neating.  Membership is open to all.  There are many\nmeetings throughout New Zealand.  Our services are\noffered free of charge.  We are self-supporting\nthrough our own contributions.",
